    ### Exchanging Assets


    Cryptocurrencies are exchanged for reasons similar to those in traditional
    financial markets, including investment, trading, hedging, risk management,
    payment purposes, access to new tokens and projects, and regulatory
    compliance. Cryptocurrencies are seen as a new asset class with high
    potential returns and are highly volatile, creating trading opportunities
    for investors. Cryptocurrencies can be used to hedge against other
    investments or to manage risk in a portfolio. They can also be used as a
    means of payment for online transactions or remittances. Investors may
    exchange cryptocurrencies to gain access to new tokens or projects not
    available on traditional markets or to comply with regulations.


    ### Traditional Way - Order Book

    Assets are traded on an exchange through a centralized platform, an order
    book, where buyers and sellers place orders to buy or sell a specific asset.
    Trading involves placing an order, matching orders based on price and other
    parameters, settling the trade, and clearing it through a central
    counterparty.

    An order book is a list of buy and sell orders for a financial instrument.
    It shows the supply and demand for the asset and allows traders to make
    informed decisions. Each order includes the type, price, quantity, and time.
    Orders are matched and filled based on price and time stamp. Order books are
    used in exchange-traded markets for transparency and price discovery.


    ### New Way - Automated Market Maker

    An automated market maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX)
    protocol that uses a mathematical algorithm to create a market for trading
    assets without market makers. It creates a liquidity pool for each asset
    pair, and the pool's algorithm determines the asset's price based on the
    ratio of tokens in the pool. The AMM algorithm ensures that the pool has
    sufficient funds for trading and adjusts the price according to the trading
    volume and liquidity.

    AMMs are used in DeFi platforms and are popular for their simplicity,
    transparency, and accessibility.
