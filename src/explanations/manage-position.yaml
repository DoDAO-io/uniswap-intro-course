    Liquidity providers (LPs) can earn fees in proportion to their share of the
    liquidity pool. Here are the detailed steps on how to collect fees in the
    Uniswap interface for Uniswap V3:


    ### Step 1 - Select Pool

    Once your wallet is connected, click on the "Pool" tab in the top navigation
    bar. This will open the Pool management section. In the Pool management
    section, you'll see a list of your active liquidity positions, if any. Each
    position will show the token pair, the price range you've set, and the
    liquidity you've provided.


    ### Step 2 - Fees Section

    On the position details page, you can see the fees you have accrued in both
    tokens. This value will update in real-time as swaps occur within your price
    range. To collect the fees, click on the "Collect" button. A new window will
    appear, allowing you to choose the percentage of fees you want to collect.

    ### Step 3 - Confirm the transaction

    After selecting the percentage of fees to collect, click on the "Collect"
    button in the window. This will initiate the transaction. A confirmation
    request will be sent to your connected wallet. Review the transaction
    details and confirm the transaction by approving it in your wallet.

    ### Step 4 - Confirm and Monitor the transaction

    You can confirm the transaction from you wallet and after that you can
    monitor the transaction on a blockchain explorer, such as Etherscan, by
    clicking on the transaction hash provided by your wallet or the Uniswap
    interface. Once the transaction is confirmed, the fees will be added to your
    wallet balance.
