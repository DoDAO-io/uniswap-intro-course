    ### What is Impermanent Loss?


    Impermanent loss is a phenomenon experienced by liquidity providers in
    automated market makers (AMMs) when the value of their deposited assets
    changes compared to the initial deposit. This change in value can cause the
    provider's share of the pool to be worth less than if they had held the
    assets separately. Impermanent loss is influenced by the degree of price
    divergence between the assets in the pool and can be either temporary or
    permanent. Although it exposes liquidity providers to potential losses,
    trading fees can counteract the impact of impermanent loss, making it
    profitable to provide liquidity under various conditions.



    ### How Does It Occur?

    Impermanent loss occurs when liquidity providers deposit assets into an
    AMM's liquidity pool, and the prices of those assets change relative to each
    other. AMMs do not automatically adjust their prices based on external
    markets; they rely on arbitrageurs to buy underpriced assets or sell
    overpriced assets until the AMM's prices match external market prices.
    During this process, arbitrageurs extract profits, which come at the expense
    of liquidity providers, resulting in impermanent loss. If the relative
    prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state, the impermanent
    loss disappears, and liquidity providers earn trading fees. However, if the
    prices do not return to their original levels, impermanent loss can become
    permanent, reducing the providers' overall returns.

  title: Example of Impermanent Loss
  shortTitle: Example
  details: >+
    Let's consider an example of two friends, Alice and Bob, who each have
    $10,000 worth of assets. Alice decides to provide liquidity to a USDC-ETH
    pool, while Bob decides to hold on to his ETH. Let's assume that at the time
    of deposit, 1 ETH is worth $2,000, and Alice has 5 ETH and $5,000 in USDC.


    Alice adds her assets to the USDC-ETH liquidity pool, depositing 5 ETH and
    $5,000 USDC. The pool now has a 50:50 ratio of USDC to ETH.


    Bob, on the other hand, keeps his 5 ETH and doesn't participate in the
    liquidity pool.


    Now, let's say the price of ETH increases to $4,000. At this point, Bob's 5
    ETH is now worth $20,000, a 100% increase in value.


    In the liquidity pool, arbitrageurs will take advantage of the price
    difference by trading USDC for ETH. This will result in the pool holding
    more USDC and less ETH. Let's assume that after the arbitrage activity, the
    pool has a new balance of 4 ETH and $11,000 USDC.


    Since Alice contributed 50% of the pool's liquidity, her share of the assets
    in the pool is now 2 ETH (worth $8,000) and $5,500 USDC, for a total value
    of $13,500. This is an increase of 35% compared to her initial deposit.

    In this example, Alice experiences impermanent loss due to the change in the
    value of ETH relative to USDC. If Alice had held onto her 5 ETH like Bob,
    her assets would now be worth $20,000, a 100% increase.


    Impermanent loss is the difference between the value of the assets if Alice
    had held them separately and the value of her share in the liquidity pool.
    In this case, Alice's impermanent loss is $20,000 (the value if she had held
    her assets) - $13,500 (the value of her share in the liquidity pool) =
    $6,500.

    ### Impermanent Loss Maths

    Here we take the example of Uniswap V2 as the maths is much easier to
    understand.

    ### Factors Impacting Impermanent Loss 


    The factors that impact impermanent loss are:


    1. **Price volatility**: The greater the price volatility of the assets in a
    liquidity pool, the higher the potential for impermanent loss. As the prices
    of the assets in the pool diverge, the value of the LP's position can become
    less than if they had simply held onto the assets.


    2. **Asset correlation**: The degree to which the assets in the liquidity
    pool are correlated can also impact impermanent loss. If the assets are
    positively correlated, their prices will generally move in the same
    direction, potentially reducing impermanent loss. However, if the assets are
    negatively correlated or have no correlation, their prices may diverge more,
    increasing the risk of impermanent loss.


    3. **Time in the pool**: The duration for which a liquidity provider keeps
    their assets in the pool can impact impermanent loss. Generally, the longer
    an LP's assets stay in the pool, the greater the chance that the assets'
    prices will diverge, leading to impermanent loss. However, it's essential to
    note that impermanent loss can also be mitigated over time as fees earned
    from the pool can offset the loss.
