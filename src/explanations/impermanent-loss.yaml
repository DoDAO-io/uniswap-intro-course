  title: Example of Impermanent Loss
  shortTitle: Example
  details: >+
    Let's consider an example of two friends, Alice and Bob, who each have
    $10,000 worth of assets. Alice decides to provide liquidity to a USDC-ETH
    pool, while Bob decides to hold on to his ETH. Let's assume that at the time
    of deposit, 1 ETH is worth $2,000, and Alice has 5 ETH and $5,000 in USDC.


    Alice adds her assets to the USDC-ETH liquidity pool, depositing 5 ETH and
    $5,000 USDC. The pool now has a 50:50 ratio of USDC to ETH.


    Bob, on the other hand, keeps his 5 ETH and doesn't participate in the
    liquidity pool.


    Now, let's say the price of ETH increases to $4,000. At this point, Bob's 5
    ETH is now worth $20,000, a 100% increase in value.


    In the liquidity pool, arbitrageurs will take advantage of the price
    difference by trading USDC for ETH. This will result in the pool holding
    more USDC and less ETH. Let's assume that after the arbitrage activity, the
    pool has a new balance of 4 ETH and $11,000 USDC.


    Since Alice contributed 50% of the pool's liquidity, her share of the assets
    in the pool is now 2 ETH (worth $8,000) and $5,500 USDC, for a total value
    of $13,500. This is an increase of 35% compared to her initial deposit.

    In this example, Alice experiences impermanent loss due to the change in the
    value of ETH relative to USDC. If Alice had held onto her 5 ETH like Bob,
    her assets would now be worth $20,000, a 100% increase.


    Impermanent loss is the difference between the value of the assets if Alice
    had held them separately and the value of her share in the liquidity pool.
    In this case, Alice's impermanent loss is $20,000 (the value if she had held
    her assets) - $13,500 (the value of her share in the liquidity pool) =
    $6,500.
