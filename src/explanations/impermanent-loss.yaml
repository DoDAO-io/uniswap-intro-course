    ### What is Impermanent Loss?


    Impermanent loss is a phenomenon experienced by liquidity providers in
    automated market makers (AMMs) when the value of their deposited assets
    changes compared to the initial deposit. This change in value can cause the
    provider's share of the pool to be worth less than if they had held the
    assets separately. Impermanent loss is influenced by the degree of price
    divergence between the assets in the pool and can be either temporary or
    permanent. Although it exposes liquidity providers to potential losses,
    trading fees can counteract the impact of impermanent loss, making it
    profitable to provide liquidity under various conditions.



    ### How Does It Occur?

    Impermanent loss occurs when liquidity providers deposit assets into an
    AMM's liquidity pool, and the prices of those assets change relative to each
    other. AMMs do not automatically adjust their prices based on external
    markets; they rely on arbitrageurs to buy underpriced assets or sell
    overpriced assets until the AMM's prices match external market prices.
    During this process, arbitrageurs extract profits, which come at the expense
    of liquidity providers, resulting in impermanent loss. If the relative
    prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state, the impermanent
    loss disappears, and liquidity providers earn trading fees. However, if the
    prices do not return to their original levels, impermanent loss can become
    permanent, reducing the providers' overall returns.
