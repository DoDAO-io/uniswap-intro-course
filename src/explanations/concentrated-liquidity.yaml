    ### Recap of Constant Product AMM

    Constant product Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized exchange
    model that allows users to trade digital assets without the need for an
    order book. It relies on a mathematical formula that keeps the product of
    the two token reserves constant. The most famous example is Uniswap, which
    uses the `x*y=k` formula, where x and y represent the reserves of two tokens
    and k is the constant. This mechanism provides liquidity for trades and
    adjusts the token prices as supply and demand change, while incentivizing
    liquidity providers with fees from trades.


    ### Example of Constant Product AMM

    Let's consider two tokens, A and B, in a constant product AMM. Suppose the
    reserves of tokens are initially x=100 for token A and y=100 for token B,
    making the constant product k=100*100=10,000.


    Here are a few points for different token ratios:

    - If someone buys 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 90 (100-10).
    To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must increase:
    90*y=10,000, so y≈111.11. The ratio becomes 90:111.11.

    - If someone buys 50 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 50 (100-50).
    To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must increase:
    50*y=10,000, so y=200. The ratio becomes 50:200.

    - If someone sells 10 tokens of A, the new reserve of A becomes 110
    (100+10). To maintain the constant product k, the reserve of B must
    decrease: 110*y=10,000, so y≈90.91. The ratio becomes 110:90.91.


    In each example, the constant product AMM adjusts the reserves of A and B to
    maintain the constant k, which in turn affects the token prices as the ratio
    between the two tokens changes.


    ### Limitation of Constant Product AMMs

    While Constant Product AMMs have been widely adopted, they have certain
    limitations


    1. Capital Inefficiency: In Constant Product AMMs, liquidity is spread
    evenly across the entire price curve. This means that a significant portion
    of the deposited assets may not be actively used for trading, making the
    capital usage inefficient. Concentrated liquidity models allow liquidity
    providers to focus their capital on specific price ranges where trading is
    more likely, leading to better capital efficiency and potentially higher
    returns.


    2. Slippage: Constant Product AMMs use a simple x * y = k formula to
    determine token prices, which can result in significant slippage (price
    change due to trade size) for large trades. As the liquidity pool size
    increases, slippage decreases, but it is still a concern for large orders.
    Concentrated liquidity models can reduce slippage by concentrating liquidity
    within narrower price ranges, providing more accurate and stable prices.


    3. Limited Customization: Constant Product AMMs do not offer much
    flexibility for liquidity providers in terms of customizing their exposure
    to different tokens or price ranges. Concentrated liquidity models, on the
    other hand, provide more control to liquidity providers by allowing them to
    choose specific price ranges and even adjust their positions as market
    conditions change.


    Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity models address some of the key
    limitations of Constant Product AMMs by offering more efficient capital
    usage, reduced impermanent loss, lower slippage, and increased customization
    options for liquidity providers. These improvements can lead to better
    returns for liquidity providers and a more efficient and stable trading
    experience for users.

    ### What is Concentrated Liquidity AMM?

    Concentrated liquidity AMM is a new approach to decentralized trading that
    allows people to provide liquidity to a market more efficiently. Here's a
    simple explanation:


    1. In traditional AMMs, people deposit two tokens in equal value to create a
    liquidity pool. This pool is used to facilitate trading between those two
    tokens.

    2. In the case of concentrated liquidity AMM, people can choose a specific
    price range where they want to provide liquidity, instead of spreading it
    evenly across all possible prices.

    3. By focusing their funds on a smaller price range, they can have a more
    significant impact on that range, which means their money is being used more
    effectively.

    4. This approach helps reduce the risk of impermanent loss, as it gives
    choice to the user over what range do they want to deposit the liquidity.

    5. Concentrated liquidity AMM also allows for better price stability and
    reduced slippage, which is the change in price when a trade is executed.
    This is important because high slippage can lead to unfavorable trade
    outcomes.


    In a nutshell, concentrated liquidity AMM helps people get more out of their
    money by allowing them to focus their liquidity where it's needed most,
    reducing risks and providing better trading experiences for users.


    ### Concentrated Liquidity Example

    Let's say Alice, Bob, and Carol want to provide liquidity to an ETH-USDC
    pool using a concentrated liquidity AMM. They each have an equal amount of
    ETH and USDC but want to deposit their funds over different price ranges.


    <div align="center">

    <img style="max-height:400px"
    src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681575680046_concentrated_liquidity%20example.png"/>

    </div>


    Now, the ETH-USDC pool has separate areas of concentrated liquidity:


    As long as the price of ETH stays within their chosen ranges, Alice, Bob,
    and Carols's funds will be actively used to facilitate trades. If the price
    moves outside of their chosen ranges, their liquidity will not be used, and
    they won't earn fees from trades happening outside their specified price
    ranges.


    By focusing their liquidity on narrower price ranges, Alice, Bob, and Carols
    can provide more substantial support for the market within those ranges.
    This leads to better price stability, reduced slippage, and potentially
    higher returns from trading fees for each of them.

    We can examine some instances to understand how concentrated liquidity
    operates and how liquidity providers make profits, depending on their
    position within the range and the level of liquidity concentration. This is
    determined by the narrowness of the range in which liquidity is provided.


    ## Scenario 1 

    <div align="center">

    <img style="max-height:400px"
    src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681588401410_example_scenario_1.png"/>

    </div>

    <br/>

    Alice and Carlos have sufficient liquidity within range, but Bob's liquidity
    lies outside the range since he provided $2000-$2500. Alice earned more fees
    than Carlos, even though they both offered the same liquidity. This is
    because Alice has a higher concentration of liquidity.


    ## Scenario 2


    <div align="center">

    <img style="max-height:400px"
    src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/uniswap-eth-1/Guide/concentrated-liquidity-uniswap/1681920255744_05_concentrated_example_scenario_2.png"/>

    </div>


    In this scenario the liquidity is out of range for both Alice and Bob, but
    is in rage for Carlos.
