    ### Uniswap V2 - Liquidity Graph

    In Uniswap v2, liquidity providers (LPs) deposit an equal value of two
    tokens (e.g., ETH and DAI) to create a liquidity pool. In our example, the
    pool consists of 100 ETH and 150,000 DAI. The liquidity in Uniswap v2 is
    spread uniformly across the entire price range, from 0 to infinity. This
    means that liquidity is available for trading at all price levels.


    When a user trades in the pool, the price is determined by the current ratio
    of the two assets in the pool, following the constant product formula (x * y
    = k). In our example, the initial ratio is 100 ETH * 150,000 DAI =
    15,000,000.

    ### Uniswap V3 - Liquidity Graph

    Uniswap v3 introduces the concept of concentrated liquidity, which allows
    liquidity providers to specify a price range for their liquidity. Instead of
    providing liquidity across the entire price spectrum, LPs can choose custom
    price ranges where they believe most of the trading will happen. This allows
    them to earn more fees for a given amount of deposited capital.


    In our example, if an LP believes that the ETH/DAI price will stay between
    1,400 DAI and 1,600 DAI, they can deposit their liquidity within this range.
    This effectively concentrates their liquidity around the expected price,
    which can lead to more efficient capital usage and potentially higher
    returns.

    To sum up, in Uniswap v2, liquidity is spread uniformly across the entire
    price range, while in Uniswap v3, liquidity providers can concentrate their
    liquidity within custom price ranges, which can lead to more efficient
    capital usage and potentially higher returns.
