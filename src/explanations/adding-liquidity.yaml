    Uniswap V3 enables Liquidity Providers to concentrate their capital within
    specific price ranges, allowing them to provide more liquidity at preferred
    prices. Unlike Uniswap V2, which required all users to provide liquidity
    across the entire price curve from 0 to infinity, Uniswap V3 allows LPs to
    selectively allocate capital within the price range they anticipate to yield
    the highest return.


    To start, you need to choose which token pair you want to supply as
    liquidity.


    While any pair of ERC-20 tokens is acceptable, each pair has distinct
    qualities. It would be helpful to evaluate aspects such as Total Value
    Locked (TVL), trading volume, and the possibility of price divergence
    between these tokens in the future.


    You can access relevant information about frequently traded token pairs on
    [Uniswap Info](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools)

    After selecting a token pair, the next step is to choose the appropriate fee
    tier. Uniswap V3 offers three fee tiers for each pair:


    1. 0.01% fee tier: suitable for stablecoin pairs with minimal price risk and
    fees.

    2. 0.05% fee tier: suitable for stabler pairs.

    3. 0.30% fee tier: best for less correlated token pairs that are more
    exposed to significant price movements.

    4. 1.00% fee tier: designed for exotic assets that are highly prone to price
    volatility.

    The app will automatically choose the fee tier with the most liquidity,
    which is typically the consensus fee tier. In most cases, LPs align around
    one fee tier for a pair. For instance, the 0.3% tier has 82% of all ETH/USDC
    liquidity.


    If you're new to LP-ing, it's recommended to use the auto-selected fee tier.
    Nonetheless, advanced strategies might find it valuable to provide liquidity
    in the other fee tiers. Keep in mind that LPs who pick a non-consensus fee
    tier might be using a complex approach to counter certain risks. It's
    important to do your own research and proceed with caution when evaluating
    other fee tiers.

    To provide liquidity in Uniswap V3, you need to select a specific price
    range. It's important to consider the potential price movements of the
    assets and your willingness to actively manage the position as the market
    changes. If the price moves beyond the specified range, your position will
    be concentrated in one asset and won't earn trading fees until it returns to
    the range. You can also choose to provide liquidity across the full range,
    but the rate of return will be lower. Tools like the
    [defi-lab.xyz](https://defi-lab.xyz/) and
    [uniswap.fish](https://uniswap.fish/) can help evaluate the price range, but
    they are not audited by Uniswap Labs and may not be entirely accurate.

    Once you have chosen your pair, fee tier, and price range, you can determine
    the amount of capital to invest in the position. Simply enter a value in one
    of the "Deposit Amounts" boxes, and the corresponding amount in the other
    box will automatically appear.


    The ratio between the two amounts depends on where your price range falls in
    relation to the market price. If your price range is skewed towards one side
    of the market price, you will provide more of that particular asset. This
    doesn't necessarily have to be a 50/50 split, as some strategies may prefer
    a different ratio.


    You can adjust the ratio by moving the price range left or right on the
    chart, or by dragging the minimum or maximum price boundary. The deposit
    amount you enter will remain constant, while the amount of the second asset
    will adjust based on the new ratio and price range.


    If your chosen price range doesn't include the current market price, you
    only need to provide one asset instead of both.

    When you are prepared to proceed, you can submit the transaction. Before
    doing so, you may have to authorize the Uniswap v3 router contract to use
    tokens on your behalf, but this is only necessary the initial time you
    provide liquidity using a token.


    After the approval transaction is confirmed, you can preview the
    transaction, examine the details, and then click on "Add" to initiate the
    transaction in your wallet.
