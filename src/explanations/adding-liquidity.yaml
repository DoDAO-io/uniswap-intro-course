    Uniswap V3 enables Liquidity Providers to concentrate their capital within
    specific price ranges, allowing them to provide more liquidity at preferred
    prices. Unlike Uniswap V2, which required all users to provide liquidity
    across the entire price curve from 0 to infinity, Uniswap V3 allows LPs to
    selectively allocate capital within the price range they anticipate to yield
    the highest return.


    This tutorial will guide you through the process of providing liquidity
    using the Uniswap application.


    ## Select Pair

    To start, you need to choose which token pair you want to supply as
    liquidity.


    While any pair of ERC-20 tokens is acceptable, each pair has distinct
    qualities. It would be helpful to evaluate aspects such as Total Value
    Locked (TVL), trading volume, and the possibility of price divergence
    between these tokens in the future.
