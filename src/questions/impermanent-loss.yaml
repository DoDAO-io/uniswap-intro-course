  content: What is impermanent loss?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Impermanent loss is a phenomenon experienced by liquidity providers in AMMs
    when the value of their deposited assets changes compared to the initial deposit,
    causing the provider's share of the pool to be worth less than if they had held the
    assets separately.

  content: What causes impermanent loss to occur?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Impermanent loss occurs when liquidity providers deposit assets into an AMM's
    liquidity pool, and the prices of those assets change relative to each other.
    Arbitrageurs extract profits during the price adjustment process, which come at the
    expense of liquidity providers, resulting in impermanent loss.

  content: What happens when the price of an asset in a liquidity pool changes?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    When the price of an asset in a liquidity pool changes, arbitrageurs take
    advantage of the price difference by trading the relatively cheaper asset
    for the more expensive one. This results in the pool holding more of the
    cheaper asset and less of the more expensive one.

  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Impermanent loss is the difference between the value of the assets if held
    separately and the value of the share in the liquidity pool. In the example,
    Alice's impermanent loss is $20,000 (value if held separately) - $13,500 (value
    of her share in the liquidity pool) = $6,500.

  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    The greater the price volatility of the assets in a liquidity pool, the higher
    the potential for impermanent loss. As the prices of the assets in the pool
    diverge, the value of the LP's position can become less than if they had
    simply held onto the assets.

  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    If the assets in the liquidity pool are positively correlated, their prices
    will generally move in the same direction, potentially reducing impermanent
    loss. However, if the assets are negatively correlated or have no correlation,
    their prices may diverge more, increasing the risk of impermanent loss.

  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Generally, the longer an LP's assets stay in the pool, the greater the chance
    that the assets' prices will diverge, leading to impermanent loss. However,
    it's essential to note that impermanent loss can also be mitigated over time as
    fees earned from the pool can offset the loss.
