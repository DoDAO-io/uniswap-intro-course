  content: What are real reserves in Uniswap V3?
  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Real reserves are the actual amounts of the two tokens held in a liquidity pool. When liquidity providers (LPs) add or remove liquidity, they directly affect the real reserves. The real reserves are used to calculate the exchange rate between the two tokens in a pool, following the constant product formula (x * y = k).

  hint: 'NoHint'
  explanation: >-
    Virtual reserves are a mathematical concept used to determine how much liquidity is available for trading within the current price range. They are not actual tokens held in the pool but rather a representation of the liquidity that is active within a specific price range. Virtual reserves help calculate the effective exchange rate and slippage for trades within the given range.

  hint: 'NoHint'

    Tick spacing is the difference between two adjacent tick indexes in Uniswap V3. The tick spacing depends on the liquidity pool's fee tier, and it can be 10, 60, or 200. This means that liquidity providers (LPs) can only add or remove liquidity at price levels that correspond to the tick spacing.
