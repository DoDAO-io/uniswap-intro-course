    title: What Is AMM?
    details: >+
      Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
      code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or
      security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code,
      evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the
      contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal
      of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and
      reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a
      blockchain network.

    title: Concentrated Liquidity
    details: >-
      Concentrated liquidity is a concept employed by some decentralized finance
      (DeFi) platforms, which allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their
      assets within a specific price range rather than across the entire price
      spectrum. This approach enables LPs to focus their capital on the price
      levels where trading is most likely to occur, potentially leading to
      higher returns due to increased capital efficiency. By concentrating
      liquidity, DeFi platforms can also optimize their automated market-making
      (AMM) algorithms, improving the overall trading experience by reducing
      slippage and enhancing price stability for traders.
  - key: impermanent-loss
    title: Impermanent Loss
    details: >-
      Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of value that liquidity providers
      (LPs) can experience when participating in decentralized finance (DeFi)
      platforms, specifically in automated market-making (AMM) pools. It occurs
      when the relative prices of the assets in the pool change compared to the
      initial ratio at which they were deposited. As the AMM algorithm
      constantly rebalances the pool to maintain the desired ratio, LPs may end
      up holding a less valuable combination of assets than if they had held the
      original assets individually. The loss is considered "impermanent" because
      it can be mitigated or reversed if the relative prices of the assets
      return to their initial levels before the LPs withdraw their funds from
      the pool. However, if the prices don't revert, the loss becomes permanent
      upon withdrawal.

    title: Liquidity Pool Details
    details: >+
      In Uniswap V3, range and ticks are essential components of the
      concentrated liquidity mechanism. A range represents the custom price
      interval within which liquidity providers (LPs) allocate their assets,
      defined by a lower and an upper price boundary. Ticks are the individual
      price points within this range, equally spaced on a logarithmic scale.
      Each tick represents a change in the price ratio between the two assets in
      a liquidity pool. When the market price of the assets moves within the
      specified range, LPs earn fees from the trades occurring between those
      ticks. As the price moves across ticks, the LP's position is constantly
      rebalanced to maintain the desired ratio, with the LP's assets
      automatically increasing in one asset and decreasing in the other. This
      mechanism enables LPs to concentrate their capital within specific price
      ranges, increasing their potential returns and making the overall
      liquidity provision process more capital efficient.
