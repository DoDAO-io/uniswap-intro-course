    title: What Is AMM?
    details: >+
      Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source
      code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or
      security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code,
      evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the
      contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal
      of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and
      reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a
      blockchain network.

    title: Concentrated Liquidity
    details: >-
      Concentrated liquidity is a concept employed by some decentralized finance
      (DeFi) platforms, which allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their
      assets within a specific price range rather than across the entire price
      spectrum. This approach enables LPs to focus their capital on the price
      levels where trading is most likely to occur, potentially leading to
      higher returns due to increased capital efficiency. By concentrating
      liquidity, DeFi platforms can also optimize their automated market-making
      (AMM) algorithms, improving the overall trading experience by reducing
      slippage and enhancing price stability for traders.
