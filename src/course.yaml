  In this course, we will take a look at how Decentralized Exchange works,
  focusing on Uniswap v3. Our aim is to help you understand a lot of different
  things about decentralized exchanges (DEX), concentrated liquidity,
  impermanent loss, liquidity pools, and how to add and manage liquidity.


  In the first part of the course, we will learn about DEX. This is the
  foundation of DeFi, a kind of digital marketplace where you can trade directly
  with other people. Unlike traditional exchanges, which are controlled by one
  company or organization, DEX operates without any middleman.


  Next, we'll move on to concepts called concentrated liquidity and impermanent
  loss. If you're planning to add funds to a DeFi platform, it's crucial to
  understand these. We will explain how these concepts work and why they matter
  to you.


  After that, we'll dive into the details of liquidity pools. These are pools of
  funds provided by users, like you, that help run a DeFi platform. We'll look
  at how Uniswap v3 uses certain rules and features to make these pools more
  efficient.


  The next step is learning how to add liquidity to the Uniswap v3 platform.
  It's like adding funds to your account so that others can trade. And finally,
  we will learn how to manage our funds or position on Uniswap.

    title: What Is a DEX?
    details: >-
      Welcome to the chapter where we explore the very foundation of the
      decentralized finance (DeFi) world, the Decentralized Exchange, often
      referred to as a DEX. Here, we're going to demystify what a DEX is, how it
      operates, and why it's a crucial component of the DeFi ecosystem.


      In the traditional financial system, exchanges are usually centralized,
      meaning they are controlled by a single entity. However, in the blockchain
      and crypto world, a DEX operates differently. In this chapter, we'll learn
      how a DEX allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the
      need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.


      We'll explore the key features that make DEXs unique, their benefits, and
      some of the challenges they face. By the end of this chapter, you'll have
      a solid understanding of DEXs and why they are a fundamental building
      block in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.


      So, whether you're new to the world of DeFi or looking to brush up on your
      knowledge, this chapter will offer you valuable insights into the inner
      workings of decentralized exchanges. Let's dive in and explore the
      exciting world of DEXs.

    title: Concentrated Liquidity
    details: >-
      Concentrated liquidity is a concept employed by some decentralized finance
      (DeFi) platforms, which allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their
      assets within a specific price range rather than across the entire price
      spectrum. This approach enables LPs to focus their capital on the price
      levels where trading is most likely to occur, potentially leading to
      higher returns due to increased capital efficiency. By concentrating
      liquidity, DeFi platforms can also optimize their automated market-making
      (AMM) algorithms, improving the overall trading experience by reducing
      slippage and enhancing price stability for traders.

  - key: impermanent-loss
    title: Impermanent Loss
    details: >-
      Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of value that liquidity providers
      (LPs) can experience when participating in decentralized finance (DeFi)
      platforms, specifically in automated market-making (AMM) pools. It occurs
      when the relative prices of the assets in the pool change compared to the
      initial ratio at which they were deposited. As the AMM algorithm
      constantly rebalances the pool to maintain the desired ratio, LPs may end
      up holding a less valuable combination of assets than if they had held the
      original assets individually. The loss is considered "impermanent" because
      it can be mitigated or reversed if the relative prices of the assets
      return to their initial levels before the LPs withdraw their funds from
      the pool. However, if the prices don't revert, the loss becomes permanent
      upon withdrawal.

    title: Liquidity Pool Details
    details: >+
      In Uniswap V3, range and ticks are essential components of the
      concentrated liquidity mechanism. A range represents the custom price
      interval within which liquidity providers (LPs) allocate their assets,
      defined by a lower and an upper price boundary. Ticks are the individual
      price points within this range, equally spaced on a logarithmic scale.
      Each tick represents a change in the price ratio between the two assets in
      a liquidity pool. When the market price of the assets moves within the
      specified range, LPs earn fees from the trades occurring between those
      ticks. As the price moves across ticks, the LP's position is constantly
      rebalanced to maintain the desired ratio, with the LP's assets
      automatically increasing in one asset and decreasing in the other. This
      mechanism enables LPs to concentrate their capital within specific price
      ranges, increasing their potential returns and making the overall
      liquidity provision process more capital efficient.

    title: Adding Liquidity
    details: >+
      Creating a liquidity provider position in Uniswap v3 involves depositing
      two different tokens into a specific pool, which represents a specific
      price range for those tokens. This is different from Uniswap v2, where
      liquidity providers could only deposit tokens in a single pool with a
      fixed price ratio. In Uniswap v3, liquidity providers can choose to
      deposit tokens in multiple pools with different price ranges, which allows
      them to provide liquidity more efficiently. Once the tokens are deposited,
      liquidity providers receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return,
      which represent their share of the pool. LP tokens can be used to withdraw
      their share of the deposited tokens, plus a share of the trading fees
      earned by the pool, when they are ready to exit their position.
