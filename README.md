 ## Getting Started With Uniswap
 This course explains what is AMM, what is concentrated liquidity, and how to create a position on Uniswap V3.
 
 ## Description
 In this course, we will take a look at how Decentralized Exchange works, focusing on Uniswap v3. Our aim is to help you understand a lot of different things about decentralized exchanges (DEX), concentrated liquidity, impermanent loss, liquidity pools, and how to add and manage liquidity.

In the first part of the course, we will learn about DEX. This is the foundation of DeFi, a kind of digital marketplace where you can trade directly with other people. Unlike traditional exchanges, which are controlled by one company or organization, DEX operates without any middleman.

Next, we'll move on to concepts called concentrated liquidity and impermanent loss. If you're planning to add funds to a DeFi platform, it's crucial to understand these. We will explain how these concepts work and why they matter to you.

After that, we'll dive into the details of liquidity pools. These are pools of funds provided by users, like you, that help run a DeFi platform. We'll look at how Uniswap v3 uses certain rules and features to make these pools more efficient.

The next step is learning how to add liquidity to the Uniswap v3 platform. It's like adding funds to your account so that others can trade. And finally, we will learn how to manage our funds or position on Uniswap.
