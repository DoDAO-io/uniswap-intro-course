      "details": "Smart contract auditing is the process of reviewing and testing the source code of a smart contract to identify any potential vulnerabilities or security issues. This can include checking for errors in the code, evaluating the contract's overall design and architecture, and testing the contract's functionality to ensure that it performs as intended. The goal of a smart contract audit is to ensure that the contract is secure and reliable, and that it will function as intended when deployed on a blockchain network.\n\n",

      "title": "Concentrated Liquidity",
      "details": "Concentrated liquidity is a concept employed by some decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their assets within a specific price range rather than across the entire price spectrum. This approach enables LPs to focus their capital on the price levels where trading is most likely to occur, potentially leading to higher returns due to increased capital efficiency. By concentrating liquidity, DeFi platforms can also optimize their automated market-making (AMM) algorithms, improving the overall trading experience by reducing slippage and enhancing price stability for traders.",

      "title": "Impermanent Loss",
      "details": "Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of value that liquidity providers (LPs) can experience when participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, specifically in automated market-making (AMM) pools. It occurs when the relative prices of the assets in the pool change compared to the initial ratio at which they were deposited. As the AMM algorithm constantly rebalances the pool to maintain the desired ratio, LPs may end up holding a less valuable combination of assets than if they had held the original assets individually. The loss is considered \"impermanent\" because it can be mitigated or reversed if the relative prices of the assets return to their initial levels before the LPs withdraw their funds from the pool. However, if the prices don't revert, the loss becomes permanent upon withdrawal.",
