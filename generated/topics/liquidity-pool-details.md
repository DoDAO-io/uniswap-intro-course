## Liquidity Pool Details
 
In Uniswap V3, range and ticks are essential components of the concentrated liquidity mechanism. A range represents the custom price interval within which liquidity providers (LPs) allocate their assets, defined by a lower and an upper price boundary. Ticks are the individual price points within this range, equally spaced on a logarithmic scale. Each tick represents a change in the price ratio between the two assets in a liquidity pool. When the market price of the assets moves within the specified range, LPs earn fees from the trades occurring between those ticks. As the price moves across ticks, the LP's position is constantly rebalanced to maintain the desired ratio, with the LP's assets automatically increasing in one asset and decreasing in the other. This mechanism enables LPs to concentrate their capital within specific price ranges, increasing their potential returns and making the overall liquidity provision process more capital efficient.
