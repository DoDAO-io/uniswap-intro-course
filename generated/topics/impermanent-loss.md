## Impermanent Loss
 
Impermanent loss is a temporary loss of value that liquidity providers (LPs) can experience when participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, specifically in automated market-making (AMM) pools. It occurs when the relative prices of the assets in the pool change compared to the initial ratio at which they were deposited. As the AMM algorithm constantly rebalances the pool to maintain the desired ratio, LPs may end up holding a less valuable combination of assets than if they had held the original assets individually. The loss is considered "impermanent" because it can be mitigated or reversed if the relative prices of the assets return to their initial levels before the LPs withdraw their funds from the pool. However, if the prices don't revert, the loss becomes permanent upon withdrawal.
