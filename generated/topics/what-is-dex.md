## What Is a DEX?
 
Welcome to the chapter where we explore the very foundation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, the Decentralized Exchange, often referred to as a DEX. Here, we're going to demystify what a DEX is, how it operates, and why it's a crucial component of the DeFi ecosystem.

In the traditional financial system, exchanges are usually centralized, meaning they are controlled by a single entity. However, in the blockchain and crypto world, a DEX operates differently. In this chapter, we'll learn how a DEX allows for direct peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.

We'll explore the key features that make DEXs unique, their benefits, and some of the challenges they face. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of DEXs and why they are a fundamental building block in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.

So, whether you're new to the world of DeFi or looking to brush up on your knowledge, this chapter will offer you valuable insights into the inner workings of decentralized exchanges. Let's dive in and explore the exciting world of DEXs.
