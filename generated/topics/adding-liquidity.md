## Adding Liquidity
 
Creating a liquidity provider position in Uniswap v3 involves depositing two different tokens into a specific pool, which represents a specific price range for those tokens. This is different from Uniswap v2, where liquidity providers could only deposit tokens in a single pool with a fixed price ratio. In Uniswap v3, liquidity providers can choose to deposit tokens in multiple pools with different price ranges, which allows them to provide liquidity more efficiently. Once the tokens are deposited, liquidity providers receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return, which represent their share of the pool. LP tokens can be used to withdraw their share of the deposited tokens, plus a share of the trading fees earned by the pool, when they are ready to exit their position.
