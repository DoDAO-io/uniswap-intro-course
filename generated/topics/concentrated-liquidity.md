## Concentrated Liquidity
 
Concentrated liquidity is a concept employed by some decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, which allows liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their assets within a specific price range rather than across the entire price spectrum. This approach enables LPs to focus their capital on the price levels where trading is most likely to occur, potentially leading to higher returns due to increased capital efficiency. By concentrating liquidity, DeFi platforms can also optimize their automated market-making (AMM) algorithms, improving the overall trading experience by reducing slippage and enhancing price stability for traders.
